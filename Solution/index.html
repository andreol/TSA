<p>Cisco SD-WAN Viptela is the solution suggested to help CENCOSUD to move your network to a digital transformation</p>
<p>With SD-WAN Viptela we will be able to address network requirements and enable new features like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Application Aware Routing</li>
<li>Forward Error Correction</li>
<li>Packet Duplication</li>
<li>QoS</li>
<li>SD-WAN Routing</li>
<li>Any Transport</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="application-aware-routing">Application Aware Routing</h2>
<p>Application-aware routing tracks network and path characteristics of the data plane tunnels between Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices and uses the collected information to compute optimal paths for data traffic. These characteristics include packet loss, latency, and jitter, and the load, cost and bandwidth of a link. The ability to consider factors in path selection other than those used by standard routing protocols—such as route prefixes, metrics, link-state information, and route removal on the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN device—offers a number of advantages to an enterprise:</p>
<p>In normal network operation, the path taken by application data traffic through the network can be optimized, by directing it to WAN links that support the required levels of packet loss, latency, and jitter defined in an application’s SLA.</p>
<p>In the face of network brownouts or soft failures, performance degradation can be minimized. The tracking of network and path conditions by application-aware routing in real time can quickly reveal performance issues, and it automatically activates strategies that redirect data traffic to the best available path. As the network recovers from the soft failure conditions, application-aware routing automatically readjusts the data traffic paths.</p>
<p>Network costs can be reduced because data traffic can be more efficiently load-balanced.</p>

<h2 id="forward-error-correction-fec">Forward Error Correction (FEC)</h2>
<p>Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a mechanism to recover lost packets on a link by sending extra “parity” packets for every group (N) of packets. As long as the receiver receives a subset of packets in the group (at-least N-1) and the parity packet, up to a single lost packet in the group can be recovered. FEC is supported on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices.</p>

<h2 id="packet-duplication-for-noisy-channels">Packet Duplication for Noisy Channels</h2>
<p>Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices use packet duplication to overcome packet loss.</p>
<p>Packet duplication sends copies of packets on alternate available paths to reach Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices. If one of the packets is lost, a copy of the packet is forwarded to the server. Receiving Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices discard copies of the packet and forward one packet to the server.</p>
<p>Packet duplication is suitable for edges with multiple access links. Once packet duplication is configured and pushed to your device, you can see the tunnel packet duplication statistics.</p>

<h2 id="qos">QoS</h2>
<p>Forwarding takes the data packet and sends it over the transport to the remote side, specifying what to do with the packet. It specifies the interface through which packets are sent to reach the service side of a remote router.</p>
<p>Once the control plane connections of the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network are up and running, data traffic flows automatically over the IPsec connections between the routers. Because data traffic never goes to or through the centralized vSmart controller, forwarding only occurs between the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices as they send and receive data traffic.</p>
<p>While the routing protocols running in the control plane provide a router the best route to reach the network that is on the service side of a remote router, there will be situations where it is beneficial to select more specific routes. Using forwarding, there are ways you can affect the flow of data traffic. Forwarding takes the data packet and sends it over the transport to the remote side, specifying what to do with the packet. It specifies the interface through which packets are sent to reach the service side of a remote router.</p>
<p>To modify the default data packet forwarding flow, you create and apply a centralized data policy or a localized data policy. With a centralized data policy, you can manage the paths along which traffic is routed through the network, and you can permit or block traffic based on the address, port, and DSCP fields in the packet's IP header. With a localized data policy, you can control the flow of data traffic into and out of the interfaces of a router, enabling features such as quality of service (QoS).</p>

<h2 id="sd-wan-routing">SD-WAN Routing</h2>
<p>Underlay vs Overlay Routing</p>
<p>The Cisco SD-WAN network is divided into the two distinct parts: the underlay and overlay network. The underlay network is the physical network infrastructure which connects network devices such as routers and switches together and routes traffic between devices using traditional routing mechanisms. In the SD-WAN network, this is typically made up of the connections from the WAN Edge router to the transport network and the transport network itself. The network ports that connect to the underlay network are part of VPN 0, the transport VPN. Getting connectivity to the Service Provider gateway in the transport network usually involves configuring a static default gateway (most common), or by configuring a dynamic routing protocol, such as BGP or OSPF. These routing processes for the underlay network are confined to VPN 0 and their primary purpose is for reachability to TLOCs on other WAN Edge routers so that IPsec tunnels can be built to form the overlay network.</p>
<p>The IPsec tunnels which traverse from site-to-site using the underlay network help to form the SD-WAN overlay network. The Overlay Management Protocol (OMP), a TCP-based protocol similar to BGP, provides the routing for the overlay network. The protocol runs between vSmart controllers and WAN Edge routers where control plane information is exchanged over secure DTLS or TLS connections. The vSmart controller acts a lot like a route reflector; it receives routes from WAN Edge routers, processes and applies any policy to them, and then advertises the routes to other WAN Edge routers in the overlay network.</p>
